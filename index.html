                       <p>The web is a whole bunch of interconnected computers talking to one another</p>

                       <p>
                               HTML is a markup language for describing web documents (web pages).HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.A markup language is a set of markup tags. HTML documents are described by HTML tags.Each HTML tag describes different document content.

                       </p>

                       <h2> What are HTML tags/elements </h2>

                        <p>

                           They are  angled brackets . You will find these brackets on your keyboard just above the comma and period. Inside these tags are words or letters that tell the computer what to do. For example hr tag tells the browser to display a horizontal line. These words or letters are called elements.

                       </p>

                       <p>

                        Tags can have attributes. Attributes can provide additional information about the HTML elements on
                        your page. The tags tells the browser to do something, while the attribute tells the browser how to
                        do it.

                       <p>

                           The Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools for short), are a set of web authoring and debugging tools built into Google Chrome. The DevTools provide web developers deep access into the internals of the browser and their web application. We can use the DevTools to efficiently track down layout issues, set JavaScript breakpoints, and get insights for code optimization.

                       <p>
                              The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...

                        <p>

                           When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. 

                           It defines:

                            <br>    The HTML elements as objects

                            <br>    The properties of all HTML elements

                            <br>    The methods to access all HTML elements

                            <br>    The events for all HTML elements

                            <br>    In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or        delete HTML elements.

                       <p>

                        A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files. But when writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.

                       <p>

                           JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web.Programming makes computers do what you want them to do. This is a an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.

                       <h2> OOP in JS </h2>

                       <p>
                              Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses abstraction to create models based on the real world. OOP uses several techniques from previously established paradigms, including modularity, polymorphism, and encapsulation. OOP promotes greater flexibility and maintainability in programming, and is widely popular in large-scale software engineering. Because OOP strongly emphasizes modularity, object-oriented code is simpler to develop and easier to understand later on. Object-oriented code promotes more direct analysis, coding, and understanding of complex situations and procedures than less modular programming techniques.

                       <h2> JS libraries like JQuery </h2>

                        <p>

                           A JavaScript library is a library of pre-written JavaScript which allows for easier development of JavaScript-based applications, especially for AJAX and other web-centric technologies. With the expanded demands for JavaScript, an easier means for programmers to develop such dynamic interfaces was needed. Thus, JavaScript libraries such as Prototype, script.aculo.us, Ext Core, JsPHP, MooTools and jQuery and JavaScript widget libraries such as Ext JS, DHTMLX, and Dojo Toolkit were developed, allowing for developers to concentrate more upon more distinctive applications of Ajax.

                       <p>

                             jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library created by John Resig in 2006 with a nice motto âˆ’ Write less, do more. jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.
